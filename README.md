Exercise 1

Program will check whether number is Perfect, Defective or Abundent number from the list of number provided by user in run time.


Exercise 2:

1. JavaScript will asynchronously gather information from all sources and build a three-dimensional array to produce a line and bar graph.

2. For uniformity, prepared data from all three data sources will be inserted into a three-dimensional array first.

3. Prior to creating a line graph The date column will be used to sort arrays in ascending order.

4. Because the source data may change at any time, data points for charts will be dynamically genreated.

5. The line graph will generate till the final entry data point in the source data using the "Minimum date from the data source.

6. Important JavaScript functions (reduce, group by) are used to determine the percentage by value for each category in order to create a bar graph.



1. Bar Graph representing category and it's corresponding percentage value from all data source.
